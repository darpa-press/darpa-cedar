<br/><br/>

I’m vain as a sow  
born in cold weather,  
born in cold water,

born in a crest  
of bending red cattails.  
I was born in a crest

of bending red cattails,  
born at the overgrown  
breast of my mother.

I’m vain as the crest  
of a bending red udder,  
messed up

by the suck of my fussing,  
my hunger. I hungered,  
was red at the chest

and blue at the neck,  
born under-grown  
in a mess of red matter.

I was born in a mess  
of red matter,  
in a pool of cold water,

born by a wrest  
at the wrist of a doctor,  
who placed me against

my mother’s wrecked  
bladder. I was born  
under the crest of the neck

of a hammer. And I bled  
at the end, at the bend  
of my waist and the wend

of my chest and the rung  
of my ribs and the poll  
of my lung. Red

as the bend of a cattail,  
vain as the red  
of a cattail. I went under:

vain as a sow born  
under a ladder.  
I was vain as a ladder.
